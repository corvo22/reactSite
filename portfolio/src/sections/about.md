Hello, I am a Computer Science student at Drexel University. This website serves as a hub for my projects, including a copy of my resume. I am very interested in the intersection of arts/music and computer science, systems programming, data structures/algorithms, and computer science education. Professionally, I am particularly interested in applications of machine learning and AI to enterprise systems, creating, maintaining, and improving RESTFul APIs at scale, and large data analysis/manipulation. Additionally, In a world where data is measured by the zettabytes, It is imperative to look beyond human-level computation and analysis, instead synthesizing a mix of human-centered interaction and AI/ML Techniques. For these reasons, I chose to do concentrations in AI/ML and Computational Systems (OS, Networks, DBs, etc).

At the heart of computer science is an undying love for teasing away at problems like strings in a knot. The ability to use interwoven technologies to solve advanced problems is fascinating and what I hope to continue doing.

TAing:  

I have a great interest in computer science education and have become a TA at Drexel to further this. TAing has been an eye opening experience, letting me learn how to communicate ideas, pedagogical technique, forming better relationships with professors, and reinforcing the concepts I learn. In this role, I also serve as a peer mentor for many younger students, some of which who've become TAs themself.

I have TAd for Introduction to CS and CS Principles, and Python I/II, but my main focus is the Freshman Design Sequence. As the Head TA for the Freshman Design Sequence, I work closely with the instructional team to refine pedegogical methods and refine the course. My changes, such as an increased emphasis on technical communication, clarified expectations, active learning, and TA training material and resources have had a noticeable impact through scores, student testimonials, and my 4-time nomination for the undergraduate TA award.

Music and Writing:  

I've played bass guitar for nine years, starting freshman year of high school, participating in my school's
marching, jazz, and concert bands. In marching band, we won 3 championships in my 4 years, with me as
section leader when our section posted the best score in school history. I compose in my free time, being
influenced from artists as diverse as Theolonius Monk, Vulfpeck, Stormzy, Arctic Monkeys, Velvet Underground
and The Grateful Dead, among others.

I am also an avid writer, particularly short works or poetry. I've written for about as long as I can remember and the oldest "poem" I can find with my name on it is from second grade. Needless to say, my work has improved much since then. The itch to write came from my father, a musician and lyricist who encouraged this behavoir from a young age. I hope to publish my work some day.

Hello, I am a Computer Science student at Drexel University. This website serves as a hub for my projects, including a copy of my resume. I am very interested in the intersection of arts/music and computer science, systems programming, data structures/algorithms, and computer science education. Additionally, In a world where data is measured by the zettabytes, It is imperative to look beyond human-level computation and analysis, instead synthesizing a mix of human-centered interaction and AI/ML Techniques. For these reasons, I chose to do concentrations in AI/ML and Computational Systems (OS, Networks, DBs, etc).
